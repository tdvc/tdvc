- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Thor Vestergaard Christiansen, a PhD student at the Technical University of Denmark, DTU. Check out my website: www.thorshammer.dk 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning based methods for reprsentation of 3D objects. The fields of image analysis and image synthesis have experienced rapid development with the introduction of transformers and the development of machine learning techniques. However, the same cannot be said about 3D objects. So why is that? My PhD project tries to answer this question and develop new learning based techniques.
